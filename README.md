# Space-Game
I want to say that this game is going to be partly replicated by a game I use to play when I was a kid. I've always enjoyed playing video games, and this one stuck out to me cause I enjoyed the simplicity it gave, and it will give me a challenge. 

To start out, this game will feature a one-player astronaut, who will face off a hoarde of aliens. 

The player will have to defeat a hoarde of 30 to win the game, using the weapon equipped by the astronaut.

1 astronaut, and 4 aliens at a time. 

if an alien touches the astronaut, the alien dies, and the astronaut loses hp.

the astronaut can only be touched twice, and upon the third touch, the astronaut dies, ending the game.
