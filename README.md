# Space-Game
I want to say that this game is going to be partly replicated by a game I use to play when I was a kid. I've always enjoyed playing video games, and this one stuck out to me cause I enjoyed the simplicity it gave, and it will give me a challenge. 

To start out, this game will feature a one-player astronaut, who will face off a hoarde of aliens.
